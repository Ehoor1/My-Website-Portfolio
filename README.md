# My-Website-Portfolio

This is a portfolio of websites I have created/in progress.

WoW Fansite:

	My final project for my Web Foundations I class. 
	More of a webpage then a website, but I'm proud of it regardless.
	It was my first ever real project and it serves as a reminder of where I began.
	I'll admit that it was more of a challenge than it should have been, but I gained valuable knowledge regardless.
