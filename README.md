# My-Website-Portfolio

This is a portfolio of websites I have created/in progress.

	WoW Fansite - My final project for my Web Foundations I class. 
	More of a webpage then a website, but I'm proud of it regardless.
	It was my first ever project and it serves as a reminder of where I began

	Italian Rest. Menu - As the name implies, it is a menu for a (obviously) fake Italian Restaurant named "Sketti' Palace".
	This is NOT meant to be a finished website but rather, a test of my ability.
	I wanted to learn how to work better with positioning and responsive design.
	Unfortunately, at the time of creating this website, I have no experience with JavaScript, so It's the husk of a wesbite more than anything.
